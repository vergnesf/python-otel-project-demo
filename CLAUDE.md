# CLAUDE.md — python-otel-project-demo

## Project Nature

Personal **learning lab**, not a production app. Simplicity over engineering.
Each service exists to learn a specific Python/OTEL/infra concept.

## Architecture

Two-layer model:
- **Business layer (KEEPER)** — generates activity and OTEL telemetry → Grafana
- **Agent layer** — reads observability data via MCP Grafana (future / in progress)

## KEEPER Services

| Service | Type | Framework |
|---------|------|-----------|
| `ms-customer` | Kafka producer | none |
| `ms-supplier` | Kafka producer | none |
| `ms-ordercheck` | Kafka consumer | none |
| `ms-suppliercheck` | Kafka consumer | none |
| `ms-ordermanagement` | Background worker | none |
| `ms-order` | REST API + DB | Flask + SQLAlchemy |
| `ms-stock` | REST API + DB | Flask + SQLAlchemy |
| `lib-models` | Shared library | Pydantic v2 |
| `lib-ai` | Shared AI library | LangChain + MCP |
| `config` | Infra config files | YAML |

## Active Services

- `benchmark` — ACTIVE: test suite for AI agent APIs (latency, throughput, multi-model comparison)
- `agent-traduction` — ACTIVE: translation agent (FastAPI)

## Framework Convention

- **Flask** for KEEPER HTTP services (`ms-order`, `ms-stock`) — synchronous, SQLAlchemy-based. No migration to FastAPI planned.
- **FastAPI** for all agent services — async, LLM-friendly.

## Tools

- **Python 3.14+** and **UV** — see `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md` for full conventions.
  Critical rule: always `uv run <cmd>`, never call `python`/`pip`/`pytest` directly.
- **Docker Compose** — 7 split files orchestrated via `Taskfile.yml` (go-task >= 3.28, install: `mise use task@latest` or `brew install go-task`)
- **Ruff** — linting and formatting, line-length=200, rules: E, F, W, I (configured in root `pyproject.toml`)
- **Pyright** — type checking

## Key Task Targets

```bash
task compose-up       # Start full stack (observability → db → kafka → ai-tools → ai → apps → traefik) — idempotent: running containers are preserved; use compose-down first to apply config/image changes
task compose-down     # Stop all services: traefik first (ingress), then apps → ai → ai-tools → kafka → db → observability
task lint             # Ruff check across all projects (PROJECTS var — includes agents)
task tools-format     # Ruff format across all projects (runs from repo root, applies root pyproject.toml config)
task models-init      # Pull Ollama AI models (mistral, llama, qwen, etc.)
task test             # test-lint → test-unit → test-integration (sequential, stops on first failure)
task --continue test  # Run all test phases even if one fails
task test-lint        # Ruff check scoped to KEEPER_SERVICES only (subset of lint)
task test-unit        # Pytest smoke tests — KEEPER_SERVICES only (7 dirs), no Docker required
task test-integration # Container health checks (ms-order, ms-stock only) — skips if stack not running or runtime absent; unhealthy containers report failure
task --list           # Show all available tasks with descriptions
```

> **Taskfile variable scopes:** `PROJECTS` = all services (see `Taskfile.yml` for the full list), used by `task lint`.
> `KEEPER_SERVICES` (7 dirs) = business services with runnable processes, used by `task test-lint` and `task test-unit`.
> `HEALTHCHECK_SERVICES` (2 dirs) = `ms-order` and `ms-stock` — only Flask services with container healthchecks, used by the `test-integration` health loop.
> Agent services (`agent-*`) and shared libs (`lib-*`) are in `PROJECTS` but not `KEEPER_SERVICES`.

## Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` before starting — it contains secrets and local overrides
(`GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`).
Docker image versions live in `versions.env` (committed — no copy needed, override in `.env` if required).

## Git Workflow (mandatory)

- **Always branch + PR** — never commit directly to `main`
- **Conventional Commits** format — see `.github/instructions/commit-message.instructions.md`
- PRs reviewed by a BMAD persona before merging (BMAD is the AI-assisted workflow framework used in this project — see `_bmad/`)

## OpenTelemetry Pattern

All KEEPER services are auto-instrumented via the `opentelemetry-instrument` wrapper in their Dockerfile `CMD`.
Key env vars: `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_TRACES/METRICS/LOGS_EXPORTER`.
Telemetry flows: logs → Loki, metrics → Mimir, traces → Tempo, UI → Grafana (port 3000).

## Error Injection

`ERROR_RATE` env var (0.0–1.0, default 0.1) injects random failures in Kafka producers, consumers,
and the ordermanagement worker. The Flask REST APIs (`ms-order`, `ms-stock`) do not use `ERROR_RATE`.
This is intentional — generates realistic, noisy telemetry for learning OTEL.

## Shared Libraries

- `lib-models` — Pydantic models shared across KEEPER services (editable install)
- `lib-ai` — LLM config, MCP Grafana client, agent Pydantic models (for agent services only)

## Infrastructure Access (local dev)

All services are behind **Traefik** (port 8081). Direct access:
- Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`
- Order API: `http://localhost:5000`
- Stock API: `http://localhost:5001`

Via Traefik (`http://localhost:8081`):
- Kafka UI (AKHQ): `http://localhost:8081/akhq/`
- Traefik dashboard: `http://localhost:8082`
